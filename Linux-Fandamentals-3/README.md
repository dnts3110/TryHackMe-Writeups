## Task 1 - Introduction
Let's proceed
> No answer needed

## Task 2 - Deploy Your Linux Machine
I've logged into the Linux Fundamentals Part 3 machine using SSH and have deployed the AttackBox successfully!
> No answer needed

 ## Task 3 - Terminal Text Editors
Create a file using Nano
> No answer needed

Edit "task3" located in "tryhackme"'s home directory using Nano. What is the flag?
> THM{TEXT_EDITORS}

## Task 4 - General/Useful Utilities

Ensure you are connected to the deployed instance (MACHINE_IP)
> No answer needed

Now, use Python 3's "HTTPServer" module to start a web server in the home directory of the "tryhackme" user on the deployed instance.
> No answer needed

Download the file http://MACHINE_IP:8000/.flag.txt onto the TryHackMe AttackBox
What are the contents?
> THM{WGET_WEBSERVER}

Create and download files to further apply your learning -- see how you can read the documentation on Python3's "HTTPServer" module. 
Use Ctrl + C to stop the Python3 HTTPServer module once you are finished.

## Task 5 - Processes 101
Read me!
> No answer needed

If we were to launch a process where the previous ID was "300", what would the ID of this new process be?
> 301

If we wanted to cleanly kill a process, what signal would we send it?
> SIGTERM

Locate the process that is running on the deployed instance (MACHINE_IP). What flag is given?
> THM{PROCESSES}

What command would we use to stop the service "myservice"?
> systemctl stop myservice

What command would we use to start the same service on the boot-up of the system?
> systemctl enable myservice

What command would we use to bring a previously backgrounded process back to the foreground?
> fg

## Task 6 - Maintaining Your System: Automation
Ensure you are connected to the deployed instance and look at the running crontabs.
> No answer needed

When will the crontab on the deployed instance (MACHINE_IP) run?
> @reboot

## Task 7 - Maintaining Your System: Package Management
Since TryHackMe instances do not have an internet connection...this task only requires you to read through the material.
> No answer needed

## Task 8 - Maintaining Your System: Logs
Look for the apache2 logs on the deployable Linux machine
> No answer needed

What is the IP address of the user who visited the site?
> 10.9.232.111

What file did they access?
> catsanddogs.jpg

## Task 9 - Conclusions & Summaries
Terminate the machine deployed in this room from task 2.
